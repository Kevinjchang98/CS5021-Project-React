# React front-end
App.js is the main page. The Sidebar component is the menu on the left, and GetQuery is each query's page. Both the sidebar and the contents on the right generate links and content based on GetQueryData.js's contents.

Change contents in the Sidebar.jsx file to rename the menu title, link names, etc., and GetQueryData.jsx to add information per query you want to have.
