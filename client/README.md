## Description

This is the front-end React code for the class project.

The sample queries are included in the GetQuery component which maps through the array of sample queries in the GetQueryData.js file. The stored procedure is the AircraftRecommendations component, and extra functionality of creating a new Reservation (inserting a new row into the MySQL table Reservation) is implemented in the Reservation component.
