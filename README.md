# React, Node.js and MySQL
A basic template for creating a React app to run basic MySQL queries.

For this project the front-end (contained in the client folder) was hosted on Netlify and the back-end (contained in the server folder) was hosted on Heroku with the MySQL server being a free instance of ClearDB on Heroku.
