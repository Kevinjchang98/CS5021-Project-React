## Description
This is the Node.js backend code for the class project.

All sample queries are implemented in index.js, as well as extra functionality required for creating a new reservation and calling upon the stored procedure which recommends aircraft for a particular customer. Note that due to the free ClearDB plan being used not allowing for admin permissions, the stored procedure is hard-coded in index.js, though the code to call the actual stored procedure on the MySQL server is included in a comment.
